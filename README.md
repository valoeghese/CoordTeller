For a minigame. privately distributed but you can compile it yourself

### How to compile to a jar
**EDIT: as of right now, loom  has a bug which prevents files() from working with modImplementation, meaning this cannot be compiled as easily**
- download this repo and run
- extract the zip file into a folder
- enter the main folder of the project
- open command line in this main folder
- run `./gradlew build`

The jar should appear in the build/libs subfolder once the task completes and says "build successful"
